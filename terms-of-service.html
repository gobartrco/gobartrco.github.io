<hr>

<h2>9. ASSUMPTION OF RISKS</h2>

<hr>

<h2>10. DISPUTES BETWEEN USERS</h2>

<p>BARTR encourages Users to resolve any disagreements between them in an amicable and good faith manner. At its discretion, BARTR may intervene with the Users to help them reach a mutually acceptable resolution. If BARTR elects to intervene, it does not guarantee a resolution and makes no representations or warranties regarding the outcome of any such intervention.</p>

<p>If a dispute involves a Trade covered by a Protection Plan, BARTR may conduct an internal investigation and, where appropriate, compensate the listing User in accordance with the terms and coverage level of the Protection Plan purchased. Any compensation shall be determined solely by BARTR and subject to its final discretion.</p>

<p>Users agree to fully release, discharge, and hold harmless BARTR from any and all claims, demands, liabilities, losses, damages, rights, remedies, and causes of action, known or unknown, arising out of or relating to any dispute between Users, including disputes in which BARTR intervenes.</p>

<p>Users also agree to be bound by and subject to any resolution or recommendation BARTR may issue in relation to the dispute, and acknowledge that such decisions shall be final and enforceable.</p>

<hr>

<h2>11. TRADES</h2>

<p>A Trade is formed when an offer made through a Listing for an Item is accepted by another User, and both Users agree to the terms of the exchange.</p>

<h3>11.1. Offers</h3>

<p>All Items listed available for trading purposes on the SaaS Platform are governed by and subject to these Terms of Service, the Privacy Policy and any policies BARTR implements. Any Trades shall be confirmed in writing, through a confirmation issued on the SaaS Platform or by email.</p>

<p>Each Trade must involve the exchange of at least one physical Item from each party. Optional cash amounts may be included as part of the agreed-upon exchange but shall not, on their own, constitute a purchase or sale.</p>

<p>Users may respond to Listings on the SaaS Platform by taking one of the following actions: (i) Accepting the Listing as-is; (ii) Submitting a counteroffer that includes a cash incentive; or (iii) Submitting a counteroffer with additional terms, such as exchanging two Items for the Item listed.</p>

<p>Users may exchange multiple counteroffers until both Users agree to the final terms of the Trade. Once an offer is accepted, the Trade shall be formed and the SaaS Platform shall automatically initiate the applicable payment processes, including authorization holds for Protection Plans, deposits, or cash incentives, as applicable.</p>

<p>While Users may include monetary consideration as part of a Trade, these payments are treated as part of the Trade.</p>

<p>Users may include a cash component in their offers to offset differences in the declared values of Items. For illustration purposes, if a User offers an Item valued at $800 and another User offers an Item valued at $1,000, the first User may include an additional $200 cash incentive to finalize the Trade. All cash transfers shall be handled by the SaaS Platform and finalized upon the completion of the Trade.</p>

<h3>11.2. Shipments and Trade Completion</h3>

<p>Once an offer is accepted and Users finalize the terms of the Trade, Users shall be responsible for shipping their respective Items to the other party. Shipment shall be made within the timeframe specified in the accepted offers, and Users shall provide valid tracking information to ensure proper tracking.</p>

<p>Once both Users have confirmed: receipt of the Items subject to the Trade and their satisfaction with the received Items, the Trade shall be deemed complete. Users may then submit a rating and optional review of the other User’s performance in the Trade.</p>

<h3>11.3. Deposits</h3>

<p>Once an offer is accepted, the SaaS Platform shall place a payment authorization hold on Users’ registered payment method to cover the following: (i) the selected Protection Plan fee (based on the declared value of the Item), (ii) any agreed-upon cash amount to be transferred between Users as part of the Trade, and (iii) a refundable deposit equal to or not exceeding the declared value of the other User’s Item. The amount of the refundable security hold shall be based on the declared value of the other User’s Item and the User’s own reputational score, which reflects ratings from prior Trades and history. Users with high reputation scores may benefit from reduced or waived deposit holds.</p>

<p>These funds shall not be collected unless required under the dispute resolution process or if Users fail to meet their obligations under the Trade.</p>

<h3>11.4. Cash Transfer</h3>

<p>Trades on the SaaS Platform are not structured as purchases. Rather, Users exchange Items, and may include a cash component as part of an offer.</p>

<p>If Trades include a monetary component, a hold for the cash amount shall be placed on Users’ credit cards. This amount shall be charged and transferred to the recipient once both Users confirm receipt and satisfaction with the exchanged Items. The payment shall be collected from the paying User and transferred to the receiving User through the SaaS Platform.</p>

<p>All cash incentives shall be managed directly through the SaaS Platform. Users may not bypass the Platform for off-platform payments, and doing so may result in suspension or termination of their user accounts.</p>

<hr>

<h2>12. ITEM USE</h2>

<p>Users are responsible for using the Items subject to the Trades in accordance with their intended purpose and manufacturer instructions. Users may not use the Items for any unauthorized purposes. Users may benefit from the care, custody and control of the Items subject to Trades. Users shall use the Items with proper care and caution, and may be held responsible for any misuse, or damage to the Items.</p>

<hr>

<h2>13. REFUNDS AND RETURNS</h2>

<p>The SaaS Platform facilitates trades between Users involving the exchange of physical Items. Each Trade must involve at least one physical Item from each User as the SaaS Platform does not support outright purchases or one-sided transactions under normal circumstances.</p>

<p>In the event of an issue affecting an Item, affected Users are encouraged to resolve the issue directly with each other through the SaaS Platform’s built-in messaging system. If resolution cannot be reached, Users may initiate a complaint using the “Report a Problem” feature. This feature serves to open a support ticket and notify BARTR’s customer support team.</p>

<p>Upon receiving a report, BARTR shall investigate the matter and may, at its sole discretion, offer affected Users one or more of the following options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Return the Item exchanged under the Trade;</li>
  <li>Keep the Item and settle the dispute through a payment-based resolution, subject to mutual agreement and/or the outcome of BARTR’s investigation.</li>
</ul>

<p>All determinations made by BARTR in connection with such matters shall be final and binding, and Users agree to comply with BARTR’s resolution, including any obligations to return or pay for Items as instructed.</p>

<p>Please note that BARTR does not offer refunds for unused or otherwise unsatisfactory Items. All Trades are deemed final and may not be refunded, unless otherwise provided by BARTR.</p>

<p>Users shall be responsible for returning or otherwise shipping the Items back to the other Users in accordance with the terms of BARTR’s guidance.</p>

<hr>

<h2>14. TAXES</h2>

<p>Users are responsible for verifying the price of a deposit, where applicable, prior to making the corresponding payment. Unless otherwise indicated, the deposit amounts are exclusive of any taxes and duties. Users are responsible for paying taxes charged in connection with their payment of a deposit on the SaaS Platform.</p>

<p>BARTR may collect applicable sales tax if BARTR determines that it has an obligation to collect such sales tax.</p>

<p>Users may be required to report their earnings from Trades conducted through or as a result of the SaaS Platform. As such, BARTR may also be required to report Lenders’ earnings to appropriate tax authorities if the Users generate a minimum amount of income from Trades conducted through or as a result of the SaaS Platform. In such cases and upon reasonable request, BARTR may then provide Users’ personal information to the appropriate authorities for tax purposes.</p>

<hr>

<h2>15. PROTECTION PLANS</h2>

<p>BARTR does not operate as an insurance provider, nor does BARTR provide insurance coverage. If Items subject to Trades are required to be insured by a licensed and reputable insurance carrier, the listing Users are required to secure such insurance coverage.</p>

<p>Users are required to select a Protection Plan based on the declared value of their Items. The fee for the Protection Plan shall consist of a non-refundable service fee payable to BARTR when Trades are confirmed.</p>

<p>To safeguard their Items during Trades, Users may purchase one Protection Plan offered by BARTR. Protection Plans function similarly to insurance and are intended to compensate Users in the event of loss or damage to their Items during the course of a Trade.</p>

<p>Protection Plans consist of a one-time, non-refundable cost per Trade, calculated based on the declared value of the Items. There are varying tiers of protection offered by BARTR through its Protection Plans.</p>

<p>Users may choose their desired protection tier upon an offer pursuant to a Trade. Each protection tier shall offer a different level of monetary coverage and is priced accordingly:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Protection Plan</th>
      <th>Cost</th>
      <th>Coverage (percentage of the Items that shall be refunded)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>No Protection</td>
      <td>$0</td>
      <td>0%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Basic Protection</td>
      <td>6% of the Item’s declared value</td>
      <td>Up to 70% of the Item’s declared value</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Standard Protection</td>
      <td>10% of the Item’s declared value</td>
      <td>Up to 80% of the Item’s declared value</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Premium Protection</td>
      <td>15% of the Item’s declared value</td>
      <td>Up to 100% of the Item’s declared value</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The coverage granted by the applicable Protection Plan shall be provided directly by BARTR, subject to verification, compliance with these Terms, and any additional conditions applicable to the Protection Plan. BARTR reserves the right to reject or adjust any claim that is inconsistent with the declared Item value, is fraudulent, or otherwise violates these Terms of Service.</p>

<p>Protection Plans may only be purchased at the time of offer acceptance and may not be added retroactively to a Trade.</p>

<p>BARTR offers the Protection Plans, whereby BARTR guarantees coverage to listing Users for damage, loss or theft according to the coverage provided by the applicable Protection Plan. The Protection Plans do not constitute insurance and are not an insurance policy.</p>

<h3>15.1. Conditions to Benefit from Protection Plans</h3>

<p>Users acknowledge that the Protection Plan shall apply strictly to all Items, subject to the Trade.</p>

<p>To benefit from the Protection Plan, Users must comply with all obligations set forth in these Terms. Any failure by Users to comply shall be deemed to void the Protection Plan.</p>

<h3>15.2. Exclusions</h3>

<p>The Protection Plan shall not apply to any of the following: (1) Damages and/or losses caused by: (i) extreme temperatures, (ii) exposure to toxins, unsafe conditions, or other unsuitable environments, (iii) a latent defect or hidden defect, (iv) rust, oxidation or discoloration, (v) transportation, shipping and/or the delivery of the Items, (vi) changes made to or work performed on the Items by an unauthorized party, (vii) a Force Majeure or Act of God such as natural disasters, strikes, or tariffs. Any circumstances or conduct by Users not made in good faith would void the Protection Plan. Moreover, the Protection Plan shall not apply to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Regular wear and tear;</li>
  <li>Lack of proper maintenance;</li>
  <li>Cosmetic damages;</li>
  <li>Damages, loss or defects covered by another warranty program, including any warranty offered by the manufacturer;</li>
  <li>Manufacturer defects;</li>
  <li>In connection to a recall issued by the manufacturer, and whereby the manufacturer is responsible for the necessary replacement;</li>
</ul>

<p>Users are responsible for initiating an insurance claim in connection with the Items for any loss and/or theft thereof, acknowledging that the Protection Plan shall not apply in such cases. Further, the Protection Plan shall not apply in case the Users benefit from insurance coverage or are eligible for such coverage and do not benefit therefrom for any reason in connection with the Items.</p>

<h3>15.3. Notification</h3>

<p>Users wishing to benefit from the Protection Plan purchased must notify BARTR within three (3) days after the occurrence of the damage or the incident giving rise to the damage. BARTR reserves the right to conduct an investigation. The determination of whether the Protection Plan applies is at BARTR’s sole discretion based on its findings and any investigation conducted.</p>
